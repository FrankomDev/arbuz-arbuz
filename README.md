# Arbuz-Arbuz
crappy fruit merge type game I made using raylib and box2d <br>
it's buggy <br>
I know I could make it faster using engine like godot but it wouldn't be fun

### Building:
You'll need Raylib and Box2D in your system <br>
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
### Todo:
Need to figure out why is this crashing <br>
Line which fruits can't pass
